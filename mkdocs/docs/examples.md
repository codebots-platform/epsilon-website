# Examples 

!!! tip "Looking for in-depth articles?"
	This page contains links to a selection of example projects in Epsilon's Git repository. If you are looking for more in-depth articles describing different features of Epsilon, please visit the [articles](../doc/articles) section of the website.

!!! info "Online Playground"

	If you prefer not to download/install anything just quite yet, you can fiddle with EMF models and metamodels, and with some of the Epsilon languages in the online [Epsilon Playground](../playground).

Each example in this page comes in the form of an Eclipse project, which is stored under the [examples](https://github.com/eclipse/epsilon/tree/main/examples/) dirctory of Epsilon's Git repository. To run an example, you need to:

1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project in question into your Eclipse workspace
3. Register any Ecore metamodels in it
4. Right click the `.launch` file in it
5. Select `Run as...` and click the first item in the menu that pops up

!!! warning
    To avoid copying the same metamodels across different example projects, some projects reuse Ecore metamodels stored in the [org.eclipse.epsilon.examples.metamodels](https://github.com/eclipse/epsilon/tree/main/examples/org.eclipse.epsilon.examples.metamodels) project.

If you are unable to run any of the examples below, please [give us a shout](../forum).
