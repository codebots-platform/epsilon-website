# Getting Started with Epsilon

Epsilon offers a wide range of tools so your starting point can differ depending on what you are trying to achieve.

	If you prefer not to download/install anything just quite yet, you can fiddle with EMF models and metamodels, and with some of the Epsilon languages in the online [Epsilon Playground](../playground).
	
- In most cases, your first step should be to download and install Epsilon as shown [here](../download).
- If you are a complete newcomer to model-based software engineering and the Eclipse modelling ecosystem, you should start by watching [this series of lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRwHao6Ue0YUecg7vEUQTrtySIWwrd_mI).
- If you are interested in ways to create graphical editors or views for your EMF-based models, you can have a look at [Picto](../doc/picto) and [Eugenia](../doc/eugenia).
- If you are looking for a generic textual (XML/YAML-based) syntax to create/edit EMF-based models, you should look at [Flexmi](../doc/flexmi).
- If you are interested in automating model management activities such as code generation, you should have a look at the languages that Epsilon offers for [model-to-text transformation](../doc/egl), [model-to-model transformation](../doc/etl) and [model validation](../evl) (all of which extend [the same core language](../doc/eol)).
	- To find out more about how you can run Epsilon programs within Eclipse, have a look at our [screencasts on YouTube](../screencasts).
	- To understand how you can run Epsilon programs from your Java application, have a look at [this article](../doc/articles/run-epsilon-from-java/).
	- To find out how you can run Epsilon programs from ANT, Maven and Gradle build scripts, [this article](../doc/articles/running-epsilon-ant-tasks-from-command-line/) should be a good starting point.
- Epsilon and the broader Eclipse modelling ecosystem can appear intimidating at first but if you stick around long enough, it will all make sense and you will add a very powerful and versatile set of technologies to your tool belt.
